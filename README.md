# Specificities of the program

Time Tracker is a small script that helps you keep track of the time you spend everyday on your PC

There is an agreable minimalist UI where you can change the color palette.

The program does not requieres a lot of ressources so it can be ran at all time

But if you want to keep it closed its okay because the script will still keep track of your time spent on the computer
